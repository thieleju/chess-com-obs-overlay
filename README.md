## üêõ Bugs

- Currently the stats will reset at the end of a month. This is due to the fact that the chess.com api only really provides one endpoint to fetch all games of a player for a specific month. (I'll probably fix this in the future so that games carry over) [reference](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)
